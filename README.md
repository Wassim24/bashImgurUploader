# Imgur Uploader with Bash
This is a very simplistic script that uploads any image to Imgur, it uses **curl** for the **http** request, and **xclip** to copy the result to the clipboard.

Make the script executable by launching this command : chmod +x imgurbash.sh
You can then upload any image with the following command : ./imgurbash.sh image_name

A little sound will be played once uploading is finished.
I did not take into account uploading errors to keep it very simple.

I inspired from : https://github.com/Ceryn/img especially for getting the link.

Happy uploading !
